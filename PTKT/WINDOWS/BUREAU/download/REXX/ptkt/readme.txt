=============================================================== 
1) The MVS side
===============================================================
  
Passticket support on MVS is easy to set up :
   
  - activate the passticket class :
     SETROPTS CLASSACT(PTKTDATA) ; SETROPTS RACLIST(PTKTDATA)
      
  - define a profile for the userid + application :
     RDEFINE PTKTDATA appl.group.userid -
        SSIGNON(KEYMASKED(0123456789abcdef))
  where appl is to be replaced by the application name (CICS, TSO+SMFID, etc.)
        group and userid are the RACF group & userid.
        and 0123456789abcdef (the Secured Signon application key)
        should be replaced by a valid 16-digit secret key
      
  - refresh the class : SETR REFRESH RACLIST(PTKTDATA)
      

NOTE : your regular RACF password remains usable all the time !
   The passticket is only a way of transmitting password over unsecure channels.

   From RACF documentation :

   "The RACF PassTicket is a one-time-only password that is generated by a requesting "
   "product or function. It is an alternative to the RACF password that removes the need "
   "to send RACF passwords across the network in clear text. It makes it possible "
   "to move the authentication of a mainframe application user ID from RACF to another "
   "authorized function executing on the host system or to the work station "
   "local area network (LAN) environment."
 


===============================================================
2) The PC side
===============================================================

On the PC, create a file userid.INI where userid must be
replaced by your RACF userid. In this .INI file, enter :

 sskey_CICS = '0123456789abcdef'x 

to specify the secret key for this userid + appl (CICS here for example).

Example of userid.INI file :

    /* Parameters for non secure passticket generation        */
    /* Syntax must comply with REXX rules                     */


    sskey_CICS    = 'fdfe121210561971'x    /* key for CICS   */
    sskey_TSOP390 = '1654646dffe15410'x    /* key for TSO  */
    sskey_MVSP390 = '1250022dc85ae12b'x    /* key for batch */


    allappl = 'CICS TSOP390 MVSP390'   /* list of all applic */

    gmt = 1                /* On the mainframe, local time is GMT+1 hour */


** WARNING **
=============

  PTKTGEN is a software-only Passticket generator.

  It is assumed that the secret Secured Signon application keys (stored in userid.INI)
  can not easily be compromised. These keys, once compromised, would allow
  ANYBODY to generate passtickets and to use your userid.

  A good solution is to store the userid.INI file on a disquette that you
  keep in security. Copy the userid.INI file on the disquette, scratch the
  hard disk version, and update PTKTGEN.REX suppressing the line :
             path_for_keys = '.\'  
  to force it to read the version on disquette.

===============================================================
3) Freewares used on the PC side
===============================================================

- Megacrypt/DOS from www.eticsoftware.com
- Regina/REXX from www.beyond.com

===============================================================
4) Instructions on the PC side
===============================================================

  Once your userid.INI file is created and initialized,
  open a DOS window and type PTKTGEN (alternatively, from the Windows Explorer,
  you may double-click on PTKTGEN.BAT).
  
  You will be prompted for your userid and for the application
  you want to access. The passticket will be displayed on the screen
  and also be copied to a PTKT.TXT file.

===============================================================
5) Troubles on the PC side
===============================================================

  The passticket may not work because :

- it has been generated more than 10 minutes ago ;

- your PC is not synchronized with the mainframe (local times are too different) ;

- the GMT shift in userid.INI is wrong (beware of summer time / winter time) ;

- the Secured Signon application key in userid.INI is wrong,
  or has been changed on MVS by the RACF administrator.
